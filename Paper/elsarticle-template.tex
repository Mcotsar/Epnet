\section{The Elsevier article class}

\paragraph{Installation} If the document class \emph{elsarticle} is not available on your computer, you can download and install the system package \emph{texlive-publishers} (Linux) or install the \LaTeX\ package \emph{elsarticle} using the package manager of your \TeX\ installation, which is typically \TeX\ Live or Mik\TeX.

\paragraph{Usage} Once the package is properly installed, you can use the document class \emph{elsarticle} to create a manuscript. Please make sure that your manuscript follows the guidelines in the Guide for Authors of the relevant journal. It is not necessary to typeset your manuscript in exactly the same way as an article, unless you are submitting to a camera-ready copy (CRC) journal.

\paragraph{Functionality} The Elsevier article class is based on the standard article class and supports almost all of the functionality of that class. In addition, it features commands and options to format the
\begin{itemize}
\item document style
\item baselineskip
\item front matter
\item keywords and MSC codes
\item theorems, definitions and proofs
\item lables of enumerations
\item citation style and labeling.
\end{itemize}

\section{Front matter}

The author names and affiliations could be formatted in two ways:
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item Group the authors per affiliation.
\item Use footnotes to indicate the affiliations.
\end{enumerate}
See the front matter of this document for examples. You are recommended to conform your choice to the journal you are submitting to.


\section{Material and methods}

Our principal case study examines the variation of the amphorae production located in Baetica (currently Andalusia, south Spain). During the Roman Empire, this ancient province was an important support for the production and distribution of the olive oil to the rest of the Empire, from the Ist to the IIIrd centuries. For this reason, a large-scale infrastructure of amphorae production was develop in this area with more than 80 workshops currently located along the Guadalquivir river and its tributary Genil. (citar Berni, Remesalin and Enriquito).
\\
The majority of amphorae identified in this area belong to Dressel 20 typology divided into different sub-typologies (Martin-Kilcher bibliografia). This amphora type was used mostly to transport olive oil for around 300 years. It means that olive oil was an important product in the roman empire because it was used in different aspect of the roman daily life such as consumption, lighting and hygiene to satisfy the high demand of Roman Empire. (extenderse)Most of them, were identify with stamp meaning a important economic market (Xavi).  

(contar historia de roma)


We analyse a dataset of 470 amphorae collected from 5 different workshops excavated. 
The workshops were located in Malpica, Cerro del Belén, Parlamento, Villaseca and Las Delicias. The choice of these workshops was due to two reasons. First, most of the workshops were not excavated being impossible the study of the archaeological material. Second, the workshops were selected in order to  analyse the variability depending on the distance of each workshop. 
\\
(measurements)
\\
Eight different measurements were taken for each amphorae sample of the 5 workshops studied. Most of them were focus on the rim sherds whose fragments were the most preserved on the sample (explicar también la variabilidad). Handles measurement were excluded from the study because the sample study was low. The measurements were divided into exterior diameter, inside diameter, rim height, rim width, shape width, rim inside height, rim width and protruring rim. Finally, multivariate methods were used to explore these metrical differences. 

In our study, we have only selected three variants according with three centuries (Dressel B: I; Dressel C: I-II; Dressel D: II; Dressel E: III) defined by Berni (bibliografía de Berni) . We excluded the rest of variants from our analysis ....

\\
PCA (podría poner biblio de Shennan y el de Jollife (2002) de Principal Component Analysis)
\\
We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to simplify a large number of variables into a smaller number of variables. This method allows to create a reduced number of "new variables" which contain all the relevant information of the previous variables without losing relevance. The information is expressed bla bla 
  

In our study, this method allowed us to reduce our dataset with 8 variables as measurement into 2 variables. 

 
PCA were performed in R statistical language.

Discriminant Linear Analysis
\\
The performed results with PCA were analyze with Lineal Discriminant Analyse
